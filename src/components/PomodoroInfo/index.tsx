            While the contours of the Pomodoro® are set, what you do within them
            can be adjusted to maximize efficiency. One way to make a Pomodoro®
            more effective is to use the first few minutes to review what you’ve
            done before. Other methods are discussed in the book.

          <S.Info>
            A timetable sets a limit, motivating you to complete a task within a
            set period of time. It also delineates your work time from your free
            time. Creating a clear timetable will allow you to enjoy your time
            off without worrying that you could be doing more work.
